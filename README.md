# fitVision HackUTA2024
Our HackUTA2024 submission; a computer vision project aimed at analyzing bodyweight exercise form from a mobile application using Google's lightweight MoveNet kinematic pose-estimation model. This is not meant to be a finished product, but rather a launch point for our project. 

To install dependencies, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` with Python version 3.9.13 (not tested for others) in a virtual environment.
